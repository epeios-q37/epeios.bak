# A simple example of a modern programming exercise

This project has for purpose to show, with a simple example, how to use the [*EduTK*](https://q37.info/s/xhgwkn7v) *Python* library to make a programming exercise. It features a somewhat improved version of the [*Hello, World!*](https://q37.info/s/k9hfpjbq) program.

!['Hello, World!'](https://q37.info/s/tmzd3rzv.png)

Simply retrieve the repository (`git clone https://github.com/epeios-q37/base-exercise`, or get the corresponding *ZIP* file [here](https://q37.info/s/3ckksnck)), and, in a console, from the root directory, launch `python main.py`. You may (should) also use `python3`.

You also can run this project in a web browser, with nothing to install, thanks to [Repl.it](https://q37.info/s/mxmgq3qm). Go [here](https://q37.info/s/srnnb7hj), click on the `+ new repl` button, choose `Python` as language and give the address of this repository in the dedicated field. Click on the green `run` button, and then click on (or scan) the then displayed [QR code](https://q37.info/s/3pktvrj7).

When the exercise is launched, a web browser will automatically be opened to give access to its interface, which you can see in the above picture. Scanning the displayed [QR code](https://q37.info/s/3pktvrj7) with a mobile device like a smartphone gives access to the exercise on this device.

`en.py` is the English version of the exercise, and the `fr.py`, the French one. To adapt the exercise to another language, duplicate the `en.py` or `fr.py` file in the `workshop` folder, and adapt the content to the desired language.
