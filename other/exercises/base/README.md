# A simple exemple of a modern exercise for programming tutorials

This project is for those who are interested in creating their own exercises. It's a somewhat improved version of the [*Hello, World!*](https://q37.info/s/k9hfpjbq) program.

Simply retrieve the repository (`git clone https://github.com/epeios-q37/base-exercise`), or get the corresponding *ZIP* file [here](https://q37.info/s/3ckksnck)), go, in a console, to the root directory, and launch `python main.py`.

You also can run this project in a web browser, with nothing to install, thanks to [Repl.it](https://q37.info/s/mxmgq3qm). Go [here](https://q37.info/s/srnnb7hj), click on the `+ new repl` button, choose `Python` as language and give the address of this repository in the dedicated field. Click on the green `run` button, and then click on (or scan) the then displayed [QR code](https://q37.info/s/3pktvrj7).

Nowadays, almost all young people have a smartphone, so they are used to graphical interfaces. They rarely, if ever, had to deal with a text console. For them, writing programs with a textual interface may be (falsely) considered outdated and, therefore, not very interesting. This is why modern exercises should provide a web interface, unlike the exercises usually provided with programming tutorials, which almost always have only a text-based interface. 

When the exercise is launched, a web browser will automatically be opened to give access to its interface, which you can see in the above picture.

The application corresponding to the exercise can also be opened on any device connected to the Internet, through the URL opened in the browser. This is facilitated by the [QR code](https://q37.info/s/3pktvrj7) displayed in the web browser, which can be scanned by a smartphone.

`en.py` is the English version of the exercise, and the `fr.py`, the French one. To adapt the exercise to another language, duplicate the `en.py` or `fr.py` file in the `workshop` folder, and adapt this content to the desired language.

This project is based on the [*Atlas* toolkit](https://atlastk.org). Other projects using this toolkit can be found here: <https://q37.info/s/sssznrb4>.
