# Stub for the *term2web* *Python* library.

[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/epeios-q37/tortoise-python)](https://q37.info/s/7jqrdgnx) [![license: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/epeios-q37/term2web-python-stub)](https://github.com/epeios-q37/term2web-python/blob/master/LICENSE)

The *term2web* library redirects `print(…)` and `input(…)` to a web page, and so allows to use CSS to format the displayed text. See https://q37.info/s/dh9gpjft for details.

To use this library, you can:

- install the *Pypi* package (`pip install term2web`) and the import it in your source files (`import * from time2web`),
- clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/epeios-q37/term2web-python-stub`), and put your source code in the `main.py` file, or put the lines in the `main.py` file as the first lines in your existing source code,
- do the same using this [ZIP file](https://q37.info/s/pkcp7qxh), which stores the content of this repository,
- do the same in an online IDE, with nothing to install: <https://q37.info/s/7jqrdgnx>.
