See https://q37.info/s/c7hfkzvs for details about the *Atlas* toolkit.

To use this library, you can:

- install the *Pypi* package (`pip install atlastk`) and then import it in your source files (`import atlastk`),
- clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/epeios-q37/atlas-python-stub`):
  - and put your source code in the `main.py` file,
  - or copy the beginning of the `main.py` up to the `import atlastk` line at the beginning of your existing source code,
- do the same using this [ZIP file](https://q37.info/s/7w3tcjnr), which contains this repository,
- do the same in an online IDE, with nothing to install: <https://q37.info/s/9rjht97x>.
