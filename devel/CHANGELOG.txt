CHANGELOG FOR THE EPEIOS FRAMEWORK.

NOTA :due to some issues with genuine 'Xcode' compiler, all accentuated characters of french comments in source code were stripped.

Meaning of list markers (2nd level):
- '-' (Functionnalities (should) remain unchanged) :
	- Cosmetic changes. Function/method and/or parameter name changes.
	- Changes for adaptation to changes of a module, resulting in adding or changing the type of parameters,
	   in a broad sense (parameters of a function, a method, or a template...).
	- Changes fixing compiler errors/warnings.
- '*' : Functionnality changes.
- '%' : API changes (is superseded by functionnality changes).
- '#' : Bug fixing.

- SCLPLUGIN
	* Removing test feature.


2015-03-11 :

		- 'filename' for a file name, with or without its location,
		- 'basename' for a file name without its location, but with its extension,
		- 'location' for the location (the list of the parent directories) of a file,
		- 'affix' the 'basename' of a file without its extension.
