## Content of the repository

The `atlastk` directory contains the *JavaScript* source code for *Node.js* of the *Atlas* toolkit, which is not needed to run the examples.

The `node_modules` directory (not provided by the repository, but will be created when launching `npm install`) contains the files that are needed in order to use the *Atlas* toolkit.

The `examples` directory contains some examples.

To launch an example (from within the repository):

- launch `npm install` (this have only to be do once),
- `cd examples`,
- launch `node <Name>/main.js`,

where `<Name>` is the name of the example (`15-puzzle`, `Blank`, `Chatroom`â€¦). For example `node Hello/main.js`.
