## Content of the repository

The `Atlas` directory contains the *Ruby* source code of the *Atlas* toolkit, which is not needed to run the examples.

The `examples `directory contains some examples.

To run an example, launch, from the `examples` directory, `ruby -I../atlastk <Name>/main.rb`, where `<Name>` is the name of the example (`Blank`, `Chatroom`â€¦).
