The *Atlas* toolkit is particularly well suited for educational purposes, to write modern programming exercises, i.e. with a true graphical interface instead of the usual outdated textual one. More about this can be found [here](https://q37.info/s/cbms43s9).

There is also a stub to for this library at address <https://q37.info/s/zzcn3wnx>.

## Content of the repository

The `atlastk` directory contains the *Python* source code of the *Atlas* toolkit, which is the directory you have to reference in `PYTHONPATH` in order to use the *Atlas* toolkit in your own program, unless you have installed the [*atlastk* package](http://q37.info/s/9srmskcm) with `pip install atlastk`.

In the `examples` directory, you will found following examples:

- *Blank*: very basic example,
- *Hello*: ["*Hello, World!*"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program),
- *Chatroom*: multi-user chatroom,
- *ReversiTXT*: [*Reversi game*](http://q37.info/s/zz3dzmf7) with `X` and `O` for token,
- *Notes*: note taking program,
- *TodoMVC*: [*TodoMVC*](http://todomvc.com/),
- *Hangman*: [Hangman game](http://q37.info/s/gtdtk4hp),
- *15-puzzle*: [*15-puzzle* game](https://q37.info/s/jn9zg3bn),
- *ReversiIMG*: [*Reversi game*](http://q37.info/s/zz3dzmf7) with more evolved graphics,
- *ReversiXSL*: [*Reversi game*](http://q37.info/s/zz3dzmf7) using *XSL*.

Other examples are detailed in the next section.

Except for the *ErgoJr*, *GPIO* and *RGB* applications, which are detailed in the next section, to run an example, launch, from within the repository, `python main.py`, and select the example you want to run. You can also directly launch, from within the `examples` directory, `python <Name>/` (don't forget the final `/`), where `<Name>` is the name of the example (`Blank`, `Chatroom`â€¦).

The *Stars* application is an example where the *Atlas* *toolkit* is used to control a [*Pygame*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygame) based application. Of course, *Pygame* needs to be installed.

## *Raspberry Pi*/*ODROID-C2*

**If the applications does not work on your *Raspberry Pi*, please see this issue: <https://github.com/epeios-q37/atlas-python/issues/1>**

The *GPIO* and *RGB* applications are designed to be used on a *Raspberry Pi* or a *ODROID-C2*.

For the *Raspberry Pi*, the `RPi.GPIO` *Python* module have to be installed (this is probably already the case).

For the *ODROID-C2*, The *Python* version of *WiringPi* must be installed, and the application has to be launched, from within the `examples` directory, with `sudo` (`sudo python GPIO/` or `sudo python RGB/`).

The *ErgoJr* application is experimental and to control a *Poppy* *Ergo Jr* robot.

The *RGB* application is dedicated to the control of a RGB led, and the *GPIO* (aka *WebGPIO*) application allows to control the basic pins. Here is a video to see how they work:
