## Content of the repository

The `Atlas` directory contains the *Ruby* source code of the *Atlas* toolkit, which is not needed to run the examples.

All other directories are examples.

To run an example, launch `ruby -IAtlas <Name>/main.rb`, where `<Name>` is the name of the example (`Blank`, `Chatroom`â€¦).
