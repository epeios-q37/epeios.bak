Programs from [The Big Book of Small Python Projects](https://inventwithpython.com/bigbookpython/) by Al Sweigart to which a graphical interface were added.

Despite being GUI-based, there is no heavy framework to install. Simply retrieve the repository and, from inside the repository, launch the `python` command (or `python3` if the default version is not the 3) with the name of a program. Example: `python fourinarow.py`.

Once launched, you can access the program on any device with a modern web browser connected to the Internet, including *Android* or *iOS* smartphones or tablets, using the displayed URL or the [QR Code](https://q37.info/s/3pktvrj7) displayed when clicking on `Moreâ€¦`.

The content of this repository can be tried online: [![Online demo on Replit](https://q37.info/s/kpm7xhfm.png)](https://q37.info/s/j4bpgmxq)

More programs from Al Sweigart's book will be available soon. Contributions welcome!
